# virtual-zoom-
The first code is using the OpenCV and CVZone libraries to capture video input from a webcam, detect hands in the video stream, and display the output in a window.

The second code is using OpenCV to read an image file, resize the image to a specified size, and write the resized image to a file.

The third code is using OpenCV and the CVZone HandTrackingModule to detect hands in a webcam stream, and to implement a simple zooming functionality by using hand gestures to control the zoom level of an image placed at the center of the frame.
